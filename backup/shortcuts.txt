# SHORTCUTS: Push-Up Tracker Automation

Follow these steps EXACTLY whenever you need to update your calendar based on changes in your Google Sheet:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Terminal and run:

   chmod +x ~/Desktop/download_pushup_csv.command
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/rebuild_pushup_ics.command

(You only need to do this once.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Double-click `download_pushup_csv.command`
   - This fetches the latest data from your Google Sheet and saves it as a CSV in your training folder.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Double-click `rebuild_pushup_ics.command`
   - This deletes any old .ics files
   - Rebuilds a new .ics calendar using your Python script
   - Opens the folder
   - Prompts you to open the import page for Google Calendar

4Ô∏è‚É£ Import the `.ics` file into your `Push-Up Training_2025` calendar.

That‚Äôs it!

üí° Tip: Keep both `.command` files on your Desktop for easy access.
